# CHIP_1

My programs to control CHIP

Most are used for intermediate tests
for a programmable alarm clock program

chip.h -- simple library to handle details of GPIO pins

alarm.c -- sets alarm at a time

timer.c -- sets alarm that goes off after certain time

pin_tester.c -- terminal to test GPIO pins
              -- TODO needs reading, ls pins, etc

test/ -- folder of tiny test programs
